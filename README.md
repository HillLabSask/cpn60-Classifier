# cpn60-Classifier

This repository contains training sets that can be used with the Ribosomal Database Project classifier (Wang et al., 2007) or the QIIME2 q2-feature-classifier plugin (https://github.com/qiime2/q2-feature-classifier) to taxonomically assign chaperonin 60 (cpn60) sequences.

# Versions
The classifier used in initial performance testing is **v10.1**, which contains a non-redundant set of 11,001 cpn60 barcode sequences retrieved from https://www.cpndb.ca

**v11.1** includes 16,413 cpn60 reference sequences that have undergone additional curation. In this latest release, we provide a trained RDP Classifier and a QIIME2 artifact for use with the q2-feature-classifier plugin (Bokulich NA, Kaehler BD, Rideout JR, et al. Optimizing taxonomic classification of marker-gene amplicon sequences with QIIME 2â€™s q2-feature-classifier plugin. Microbiome. 2018;6:90).
